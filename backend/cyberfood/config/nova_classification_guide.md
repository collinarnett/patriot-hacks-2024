# Group 1: Unprocessed or minimally processed foods
Unprocessed (or natural) foods are edible parts of plants (seeds,
fruits, leaves, stems, roots) or of animals (muscle, offal, eggs,
milk), and also fungi, algae and water, after separation from nature.

Minimally processed foods are natural foods altered by processes that
include removal of inedible or unwanted parts, and drying, crushing,
grinding, fractioning, filtering, roasting, boiling, non-alcoholic
fermentation, pasteurization, refrigeration, chilling, freezing,
placing in containers and vacuum-packaging. These processes are
designed to preserve natural foods, to make them suitable for storage,
or to make them safe or edible or more pleasant to consume. Many
unprocessed or minimally processed foods are prepared and cooked at
home or in restaurant kitchens in combination with processed culinary
ingredients as dishes or meals.

# Group 2: Processed culinary ingredients
Processed culinary ingredients are derived from group 1 foods or else
from nature by processes such as pressing, refining, grinding,
milling, and drying. It also includes substances mined or extracted
from nature. These ingredients are primarily used in seasoning and
cooking group 1 foods and preparing dishes from scratch. They are
typically free of additives, but some products in this group may
include added vitamins or minerals, such as iodized salt.

Examples include oils produced through crushing seeds, nuts, or fruits
(such as olive oil), salt, sugar, vinegar, starches, honey, syrups
extracted from trees, butter, and other substances used to season and
cook.

# Group 3: Processed foods
Processed foods are relatively simple food products produced by adding
processed culinary ingredients (group 2 substances) such as salt or
sugar to unprocessed (group 1) foods.

Processed foods are made or preserved through baking, boiling,
canning, bottling, and non-alcoholic fermentation. They often use
additives to enhance shelf life, protect the properties of unprocessed
food, prevent the spread of microorganisms, or making them more
enjoyable.

Examples include cheese, canned vegetables, salted nuts, fruits in
syrup, and dried or canned fish. Breads, pastries, cakes, biscuits,
snacks, and some meat products fall into this group when they are made
predominantly from group 1 foods with the addition of group 2
ingredients.

# Group 4: Ultra-processed foods
The most recent overview of Nova published with Monteiro defines
ultra-processed food as follows:

> Industrially manufactured food products made up of several
> ingredients (formulations) including sugar, oils, fats and salt
> (generally in combination and in higher amounts than in processed
> foods) and food substances of no or rare culinary use (such as
> high-fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, modified starches and
> protein isolates). Group 1 foods are absent or represent a small
> proportion of the ingredients in the formulation. Processes enabling
> the manufacture of ultra-processed foods include industrial
> techniques such as extrusion, moulding and pre-frying; application
> of additives including those whose function is to make the final
> product palatable or hyperpalatable such as flavours, colourants,
> non-sugar sweeteners and emulsifiers; and sophisticated packaging,
> usually with synthetic materials. Processes and ingredients here are
> designed to create highly profitable (low-cost ingredients, long
> shelf-life, emphatic branding), convenient (ready-to-(h)eat or to
> drink), tasteful alternatives to all other Nova food groups and to
> freshly prepared dishes and meals. Ultra-processed foods are
> operationally distinguishable from processed foods by the presence
> of food substances of no culinary use (varieties of sugars such as
> fructose, high-fructose corn syrup, 'fruit juice concentrates',
> invert sugar, maltodextrin, dextrose and lactose; modified starches;
> modified oils such as hydrogenated or interesterified oils; and
> protein sources such as hydrolysed proteins, soya protein isolate,
> gluten, casein, whey protein and 'mechanically separated meat') or
> of additives with cosmetic functions (flavours, flavour enhancers,
> colours, emulsifiers, emulsifying salts, sweeteners, thickeners and
> anti-foaming, bulking, carbonating, foaming, gelling and glazing
> agents) in their list of ingredients.

The Nova definition of ultra-processed food does not comment on the
nutritional content of food and is not intended to be used for
nutrient profiling.
